    <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>Easy Schedules is an Android application that is a solution for any business that needs help creating and managing work          schedules from the convenience of a smartphone or tablet device. Many companies still print out and post paper work schedules to give their employees even as the world becomes more technologically advanced. Easy Schedules allows employees to view their work schedules from a smartphone or tablet device. Trying to exchange shifts or getting a work shift covered is almost impossible to do with the use of paper work schedules. Easy schedules will allow employees to exchange shifts while being able to connect with coworkers through the applications messaging center.</p>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This purpose of this project was to gain mobile application development experience. To do this I made a Android application
         using Android Studios. I utilized technologies that I learned through my major at GCU such as Java, PHP, and MySQL. This       application will allow employees to simply view and manage their work schedule from an Android smartphone or tablet device.  </p>
